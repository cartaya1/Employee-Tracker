# Description :

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, the challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Los desarrolladores a menudo tienen la tarea de crear interfaces que faciliten a los no desarrolladores ver e interactuar con la información almacenada en las bases de datos. A menudo, estas interfaces se conocen como sistemas de gestión de contenido. En esta tarea, el desafío era diseñar y construir una solución para administrar a los empleados de una empresa usando node, inquirer y MySQL.

# Technology
**1. [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) NPM package** : 
* MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
* A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
* SQL is used by language programmers to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

**2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** : 

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**3. [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3)** :

* Inquirer.js strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for Node.js. 

* NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

**4. [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)** :

* Uses easy-table for printing to console.log

* Used to print MySQL rows to the console.

**5. [asciiart-logo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciiart-logo)** :
* asciiart-logo renders a splash screen in text console with logo from ASCII characters.

* Splash screen is a rectangular panel and logo is the application name rendered by ASCII-art fonts extended by optional additional information.

* asciiart-logo can be used by starting of command line tools, web servers or REST API microservices as a visual feedback to the user or administrator about successful start of the application.

* Used this NPM package to add some visual flare to the main logo. 

# Usage
* Clone this repository to use this application on local machine.

* To install necessary dependencies, run the following command :

```
npm i
```

* The application will be invoked with the following command : 

```
node server.js
```
* After running above command, user is presented with series of options to manage employee databse.

# Features
